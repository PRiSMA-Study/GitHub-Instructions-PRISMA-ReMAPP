### Invite people & Add team

If you would like to invite people to the ReMAPP Github group, please contact the administrator and provide the invitee's Github username/email. The administrator will then send an email inviation to the invitee and invitee has to accept the invitation to be able to join the group.

Please find you team and ask the team maintainer to add you as a member/maintainer to the team.

### Create repository

Please DO NOT contain any sensitive or confidential information (e.g password, identifiable data) in the repository.

Please DO NOT upload large data set to the repository, since there is not enough storage space and it takes a long time to push the large data to the repo.

You can set the repository either public (can be seen by everyone on the internet) or private (only available to the group member), depending on the intention and content of the repository.

Please add a `readme.md` fime to your repository to give an overview of the project and help other members and outsiders understand how to navigate the files.

### Ask questions using `Issue` feature

If you have any questions about a specific file in certain repository, we recommend to open an issue using the `Issue` feature and tag the person/team from whom you would like to get the response. After your question is resolved, close the issue.

### Contact

Please contact the ReMAPP Github administrator if you have any questions regarding managing the repositories.

If you have any questions regarding git or Github usage, [Github documentation](https://docs.github.com/en), [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) and Google are the resourceful places where you may find your answer.
