### Invite people & Add team

If you would like to invite people to the Github group, please contact the administrator Xiaoyan (@XiaoyanHu666) or Stacie (@sloisate2) and provide the invitee's Github username/email. The administrator will then send an email inviation to the invitee. After the invitee accepts the invitation they will be added to the group.

Please find you team and ask the team maintainer to add you as a member/maintainer to the team.

### Create/Maintain repository

:white_check_mark: Please DO

Please DO add a `readme.md` file with your repository to give an overview of the project and help others navigate through the files.

Please DO update your repository in a timely manner.

Please DO contact with the adminstrator if you have any questions regrading the Github practice.

:x: Please DO NOT

Please DO NOT contain any sensitive or confidential information (e.g password, identifiable data) in the repository.

Please DO NOT upload data of large size to the repository, since there is limited storage space and it takes longer time to push changes the repo.

Please DO NOT give higher level access (write/admin) to people outside your team.

### Ask questions using `Issue` feature

For each repository/project, if you have any questions, we recommend to open an issue using the `Issue` feature and @tag the person/team from whom you would like to get the response. After your question is resolved, close the issue.

### Contact

Please contact the administrator Xiaoyan (@XiaoyanHu666) or Stacie (@sloisate2) if you have any questions regarding managing the repositories.

If you have any questions regarding git or Github practice, more resources are available at [Github documentation](https://docs.github.com/en), [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) and Google.
